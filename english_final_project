        <h2> Introduction:</h2>
        <p>
          
 “To have a second language is to have a second soul”, by Charlemagne. When we learn a new language, this learning process it is not only write, speak, listen and read a new language. learn a new language is to learn a new culture, life and history. And the process to learn a second language is different for someone who wants to learn a second language, from someone who needs to learn a second language. In the immigrant community learn a second language is a main point for the adaptation in a new society. Learn a second language for almost all immigrants is something they need it. Jobs, documentations, supermarkets, traffics signs, and the list never stop, all those things are necessary to learn and for most people are not a barrier, but for an immigrant who not only need to care about work, children, and probably a second job and many other important things that make difficult to someone gets time and money to learn a second language, but for many stories and my own story I know this is possible. But this is different from someone who is child, these obstacles are different and the percentage of children who learn a second language is greater than that of adults. In this article I am going in details how different is to learn a language in language at a young age compared to adulthood in the immigrant community 
And the process to adapt in this new society and how literacy is important in all this procces.
